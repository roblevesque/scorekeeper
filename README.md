# ScoreKeeper

ScoreKeeper is an entirely in browser trivia scoring tool. It utilizes [Dexie.js](http://dexie.org) as a database manager, which utilizes IndexedDB and Web SQL backends. Both of which are in-browser databases.


## Installation

To install ScoreKeeper simply clone the repository or download the code and open up the `index.htm` file. Alternatively it can be placed on a web host and accessed via any device with an internet connection and a modern browser. It should work on cell phones but usability may suffer and quite frankly I haven't tested it much in this use.

## Usage
After accessing the `index.htm` file or setting it up on a web server and browsing to it you can add teams, add rounds and adjust scores for rounds. The entire interface is contained to a single HTML page.


## Possible future features
* A breakout window that can be embedded via an i-frame to show the top n-scoring teams
* Adding the full questions and answers & integrating into a HTML/JS presentation library to drive trivia right from application
